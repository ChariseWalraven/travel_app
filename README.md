# travel_app

Assignment 1 of the FlutterDevCamp

This app has a dark and a light mode. Try them both out and let me know what you think!

The purpose of this assignment was to become familiar with some of the the basics of Flutter Layout.

Specifically, the whole page needed to scroll, not just the GridView.

I took inspiration from Polaroid images for the DestinationTiles.
